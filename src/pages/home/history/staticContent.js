    content:
      "In the early 19th century there were very few breweries in Australia, so people drank expensive imported brands from England or 'rot-gut' liquors said to send men mad. Peter Degraves was a fixer - he devised a way to divert fresh water to Hobart town and even submitted plans for improving a Hobart jail during his incarceration there in 1826. Although these two plans failed, Degraves' plans for a brewery that produced 'genuine beer beer that cannot be excelled in this colony' succeeded and Cascade Brewery Co. was born in 1832. Degraves used the sparkling fresh mountain water from the cascades as well as Tasmania's quality hops to create the first great Australian beer.",

    content:
      "Latham didn't have any brewing experience but he knew a good opportunity when he saw one, so he bought the Bouverie St operation in 1864 and renamed it Carlton Brewery. For his head brewer, Latham hired Gisborne-born Alfred Terry who had the magic touch when it came to brewing palatable, bright and clear beer which preserved well. Terry's lighter colonial beers were much easier to drink in the Australian heat than the heavy European imports and soon barrels of freshly brewed Carlton Ale were being transported by Clydesdale to hotels throughout the city.",

    content:
      "In the 19th century, most buildings in Melbourne were made of wood and although fires were common, there was no official fire brigade. Carlton Brewery decided to pitch in and quickly developed a brigade made up of volunteer brewery workers. The Carlton Brewery Fire Brigade was one of Melbourne's best and most efficient it's said that they could have an engine horsed and ready within 40 seconds of the fire alarm sounding. The brigade was also innovative brigade leader and head brewer Alfred Terry invented a safer type of 'jump sheet' to break the fall of people jumping out of the windows of burning buildings.",

    content:
      "In 1887, New York-born brothers William and Ralph Foster used an innovative engine-powered refrigeration process to brew Foster's Lager and store it for 60 days at 1.6 degrees Celsius, which aided fermentation. Foster's Lager premiered in Melbourne on 1 February 1889 (the city's hottest month). In an ingenious marketing ploy, any hotel that agreed to sell Foster's received a free supply of ice and the concept of drinking a cold beer on a summer's day (up until this point beer was consumed at room temperature) quickly caught on.",
